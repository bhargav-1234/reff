    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>
      The Realty Referral Resource (RRR) Referral Associate first submits a
      buyer or seller referral through the RRR portal. From there, RRR will
      reach out to a partner agent in the locale of the referral. The Receiving
      Agent will then service the client with diligence and professionalism, as
      stipulated in the RRR Referral Agreement.The Referral Associate will not
      be a direct part of the transaction process, but he/she will receive
      periodic updates regarding the transaction progress via email.Upon
      completion of the transaction, RRR will receive the referral portion of
      the commission from the receiving brokerage, and the RRR Referral
      Associate will havehis/her referral fee direct-deposited within a matter
      of days.
